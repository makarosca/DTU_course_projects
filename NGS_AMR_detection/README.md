# NGS_AMR_detection
Alignment of raw NGS data to a list of genes encoding the resistance to antibiotics. Identification of the genes which are present in the sequenced sample

To learn more about the project and the algorithms used in the script, please read the project report. This project was implemented as a part of the DTU course 22110 Python and Unix for Bioinformaticians. As a requirement, no additional python libraries could be used besides os, sys, gzip.

The NGS data samples can be downloaded through the links below and should be put in the same directory as the script. If the links don't work, contact me at vrosca.aa@gmail.com
