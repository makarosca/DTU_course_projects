# NGS_AMR_detection
A python script for NGS raw data processing and detection of the AMR genes.


This project was implemented as a part of the DTU course 22110 Python and Unix for Bioinformaticians. As a requirement, no additional python libraries could be used besides os, sys, gzip.

The NGS data samples can be downloaded through these links and should be put in the same directory with the script. If the links don't work, contact me at vrosca.aa@gmail.com
